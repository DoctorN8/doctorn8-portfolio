## 💡 KEY INSIGHTS FROM REVIEW

### Strengths
- Strong AI project portfolio
- Good technical skills demonstrated
- Diverse background (education, music, AI)
- Published author

### Areas for Improvement
- Positioning not clearly aligned with AI focus
- Missing recent AI projects (Masonic Law Assistant, ABK Chatbot)
- Outdated platform perception (Weebly branding)
- Limited SEO optimization
- Inconsistent project presentation formats

### Strategic Recommendation
Migrate to a modern platform (GitHub Pages, Webflow, or custom site) to better reflect your technical capabilities and AI focus. This would also remove the "POWERED BY Weebly" branding that suggests a free/basic plan.
